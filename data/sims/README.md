This directory contains the simulated instances. We consider four
different simulation experiments.

1. [m5](m5/) contains simulated instances with m = 5 anatomical sites.
2. [m8](m8/) contains simulated instances with m = 8 anatomical sites.
3. [m5_downsampled](m5_downsampled/) contains simulated instances with m = 5 anatomical sites, where the purity, number of samples per anatomical site and coverage have been downsampled.
4. [m8_mut_rates](m8_mut_rates/) contains simulated instances with m = 8 anatomical sites and varying mutation rates.
5. [m8_downsampled](m8_downsampled/) contains simulated instances with m = 8 anatomical sites, where the number of SNVs has been downsampled.
