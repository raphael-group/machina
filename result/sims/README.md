This directory contains the simulation results, and scripts to generate
the plots used in the manuscript.

* [simulations_1.ipynb](simulations_1.ipynb) generates Robinson-Foulds,
  migration graph F_1 score and migration clones F_1 score plots for the m = 5
  and m = 8 simulation instances.
* [simulations_2.ipynb](simulations_2.ipynb) generates plots for the
  minimum migration enumeration algorithm for the m = 5 and m = 8
  simulation instances.
* [simulations_3.ipynb](simulations_3.ipynb) generates plots for the
  downsampling experiments.
